help.intervalCount=The number of intervals between each subscription billing. For example, interval=month and interval_count=3 bills every 3 months. Maximum of one year interval allowed (1 year, 12 months, or 52 weeks).
help.name=Name of the plan, to be displayed on invoices and in the web interface.
help.amount=A positive integer in cents (or 0 for a free plan) representing how much to charge (on a recurring basis).
help.interval=Specifies billing frequency. Either day, week, month or year.
help.currency=3-letter ISO code for currency.
help.trialPeriodDays=Specifies a trial period in (an integer number of) days. If you include a trial period, the customer won't be billed for the first time until the trial period ends. If the customer cancels before the trial period is over, she'll never be billed at all.
help.statementDescriptor=An arbitrary string to be displayed on your customer's credit card statement. This may be up to 22 characters. As an example, if your website is RunClub and the item you're charging for is your Silver Plan, you may want to specify a statement_descriptor of RunClub Silver Plan. The statement description may not include <>"' characters, and will appear on your customer's statement in capital letters. Non-ASCII characters are automatically stripped. While most banks display this information consistently, some may display it incorrectly or not at all.
