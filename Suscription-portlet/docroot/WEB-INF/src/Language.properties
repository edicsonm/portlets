help.plan=The plan the customer is subscribed to 
help.cancelAtPeriodEnd=If the subscription has been canceled with the at_period_end flag set to true, cancel_at_period_end on the subscription will be true. You can use this attribute to determine whether a subscription that has a status of active is scheduled to be canceled at the end of the current period.
help.quantity=There are not information to this field.
help.start=Date the subscription started 
help.status=Possible values are trialing, active, past_due, canceled, or unpaid. A subscription still in its trial period is trialing and moves to active when the trial period is over. When payment to renew the subscription fails, the subscription becomes past_due. After Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription ends up with a status of either canceled or unpaid depending on your retry settings. Note that when a subscription has a status of unpaid, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed. Additionally, updating customer card details will not lead to Stripe retrying the latest invoice.). After receiving updated card details from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices. 
help.applicationFeePercent=A positive decimal that represents the fee percentage of the subscription invoice amount that will be transferred to the application ownerâ€™s Stripe account each billing period.
help.canceledAt=If the subscription has been canceled, the date of that cancellation. If the subscription was canceled with cancel_at_period_end, canceled_at will still reflect the date of the initial cancellation request, not the end of the subscription period when the subscription is automatically moved to a canceled state.
help.currentPeriodStart=Start of the current period that the subscription has been invoiced for 
help.currentPeriodEnd= End of the current period that the subscription has been invoiced for. At the end of this period, a new invoice will be created.
help.trialEnd=If the subscription has a trial, the end of that trial.
help.endedAt=If the subscription has ended (either because it was canceled or because the customer was switched to a subscription to a new plan), the date the subscription ended
help.trialStart=If the subscription has a trial, the beginning of that trial. 
help.taxPercent=If provided, each invoice created by this subscription will apply the tax rate, increasing the amount billed to the customer.
